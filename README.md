# Amazon-clone

Welcome! This is the amazon-clone, written in React JS.

Feel free to put false informations (if you want), but it is not neccessary to write anything.

If you want to verify the code, before downloading this, I recommend to create a directory(a folder which name does not have upper case) where you will put the code to run these commands in the terminal:

npx create-react-app .

npm install

npm i react-router-dom

npm i react-currency-format --force

npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons

npm i react-slideshow-image --force

npm i react-rebound

npm install

(optional): npm install -g firebase-tools && npm install firebase && firebase login

And after you put the code in the same directory, run in the terminal: npm start
